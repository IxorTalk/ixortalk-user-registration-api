= User Registration API

Depending on configuration of the platform, it will be backed by either an AuthServer within the same platform or Auth0.

When the request body is invalid:

include::{snippets}/auth-server/register/invalid-request-body/http-response.adoc[]

When the authserver returns an error, the HTTP status code returned by the auth server is propagated back to the client too:

=== Generate Profile Picture URL

A secured REST call to generate a presigned S3 URL which can be used to upload a profile picture to.  The public read equivalent of this link is stored on the logged in user's Auth0 profile.  Uploading a profile picture can be done by performing a binary `PUT` to the returned URL.
